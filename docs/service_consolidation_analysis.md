## üèóÔ∏è **Consolidation Strategy**

### Phase 2.2: Arrow Management Consolidation

**Target**: Consolidate 7 arrow-related services into `ArrowManagementService`

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Arrow positioning pipeline (initial placement, adjustments, rotation)
- Arrow mirroring based on motion type and rotation direction
- Beta prop positioning (overlap detection, separation algorithms)
- Placement key generation and default placement calculations
- Motion orientation calculations for arrows

**Dependencies**:

- Domain models (MotionData, ArrowData, PictographData)
- Enhanced DI container for automatic injection

### Phase 2.3: Motion Management Consolidation

**Target**: Consolidate 3 motion services into `MotionManagementService`

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Motion validation (valid motion/position combinations)
- Motion combination generation from dataset
- Motion orientation calculations for props
- Motion type validation and constraints

### Phase 2.4: Pictograph Management Consolidation

**Target**: Consolidate 6 pictograph services into `PictographManagementService`

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Pictograph creation and manipulation
- Dataset management and querying
- Data conversion between Legacy and V2 formats
- Glyph data handling and context configuration

### Phase 2.5: Sequence Management Consolidation

**Target**: Consolidate 4 sequence services into `SequenceManagementService`

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Sequence CRUD operations
- Beat management (add, delete, modify)
- Sequence generation (freeform, circular, auto-complete)
- Workbench operations (color swap, reflection, rotation)

### Phase 2.6: UI State Management Consolidation

**Target**: Consolidate 6 UI services into `UIStateManagementService`

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Settings management (get, set, save, load)
- Dialog coordination (settings, preferences)
- Application state management (option picker, graph editor)
- Hotkey handling and UI event coordination

### Phase 2.7: Layout Management Consolidation

**Target**: Consolidate 3 layout services into `LayoutManagementService`

**Key Responsibilities**:

- Responsive layout adjustments

## üéØ **Benefits of Consolidation**

### 1. **Reduced Complexity**

- From 30+ services to 6 cohesive services
- Clear separation of concerns by domain
- Easier to understand and maintain

### 2. **Better Dependency Management**

- Enhanced DI container handles complex dependency graphs
- Cleaner service interfaces with fewer dependencies
- Reduced circular dependency risks

### 3. **Improved Testability**

- Fewer service interfaces to mock
- More comprehensive test coverage per service
- Better integration testing capabilities

### 4. **Enhanced Performance**

- Reduced service resolution overhead
- Better caching opportunities within consolidated services
- Fewer inter-service communication calls

### 5. **Cleaner Architecture**

- Services aligned with domain boundaries
- Single responsibility at the right level of abstraction
- Easier to reason about system behavior

## üöÄ **Implementation Approach**

### 1. **Backward Compatibility**

- Keep existing service interfaces during transition
- Use adapter pattern to bridge old ‚Üí new services
- Gradual migration with feature flags

### 2. **Enhanced DI Integration**

- All consolidated services use constructor injection
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Protocol-based interfaces for clean contracts

### 3. **Comprehensive Testing**

- Contract tests for all new consolidated services
- Integration tests for service interactions
- Performance benchmarks to ensure no regression

### 4. **Event-Driven Communication**

- TypeSafeEventBus for decoupled service communication
- Async operations where appropriate
- Clean separation between command and query operations

## üìã **Next Steps**

1. **Start with ArrowManagementService** (Phase 2.2)

   - Highest complexity, most interdependent services
   - Clear domain boundary
   - Well-defined responsibilities

2. **Implement Event Bus** (Phase 2.5)

   - Enable decoupled communication
   - Support for async operations
   - Foundation for remaining consolidations

3. **Progressive Consolidation** (Phases 2.3-2.7)

   - One service group at a time
   - Validate each consolidation before proceeding
   - Maintain application functionality throughout

4. **Final Validation** (Phase 2.7)
   - End-to-end testing of consolidated architecture
   - Performance validation
   - Documentation updates
