# Level 6: Conjoined Mode - Dual Grid Overlay System

## üéØ Core Concept

**Two independent grids operating simultaneously at separate physical locations**

Level 6 introduces conjoined mode where two separate grids exist at different physical locations. Motions are performed around each grid independently, then overlaid mathematically to categorize the combined motion using existing alphabet notation.

## üìê Mathematical Foundation

### **Dual Grid System**
- **Grid A and Grid B**: Two independent grids at separate physical locations
- **Separate centers**: Each grid has its own center point and 8 surrounding positions
- **Physical separation**: Grids can be adjacent, kitty-corner, or vertically stacked
- **Independent operation**: Each grid operates with its own motion rules

### **Overlay Mathematics**
- **Cross-your-eyes technique**: Mental overlay of two identical grids
- **Motion categorization**: Combined motion categorized using existing alphabet
- **Alphabet completeness**: All combinations map to Levels 1-5 notation
- **Harmonic theory**: Like musical harmony - two independent voices creating combined expression

## üîß Technical Specifications

### **Grid Configuration**
- **Two separate grids**: Grid A and Grid B at different physical locations
- **Location options**:
  - Adjacent placement (side by side)
  - Kitty-corner placement (diagonal separation)
  - Vertical stacking (one above the other)
- **Independent centers**: Each grid has distinct center point and positions
- **No shared positions**: Grid positions do not coincide in physical space

### **Motion Execution**
- **Independent motions**: Perform motion around Grid A while performing different motion around Grid B
- **Simultaneous execution**: Both motions occur at the same time
- **Staff configuration**: One staff per grid, operating independently
- **Motion isolation**: Each grid motion follows Levels 1-5 rules independently

### **Overlay Categorization**
- **Mental overlay**: Imagine grids overlaid as if crossing your eyes
- **Combined motion**: Overlay creates single combined motion pattern
- **Alphabet mapping**: Combined motion expressible using existing Levels 1-5 notation
- **Categorization process**: Use overlay to determine equivalent alphabet letter

### **Alphabet Completeness Theorem**
- **Complete mapping**: All dual-grid combinations map to existing notation
- **No new notation needed**: Existing alphabet covers all possibilities
- **Mathematical completeness**: Anything doable on two grids is expressible on one grid
- **Equivalence principle**: Two-grid combinations equivalent to single-grid combinations

## üìä Combination Mathematics

### **Exponential Expansion**
- **Grid combination**: Each grid can perform any Levels 1-5 combination
- **Exponential scaling**: Grid A combinations √ó Grid B combinations
- **5,000+ combinations**: Exponential increase from Level 5
- **Overlay reduction**: All combinations reduce to existing alphabet

### **Mathematical Properties**
- **Vectorial combination**: Information needed about vector mathematics
- **Harmonic theory**: Two independent motion voices
- **Completeness preservation**: All combinations map to existing notation
- **Exponential complexity**: Massive expansion in expressive possibilities

## üéì Learning Requirements
