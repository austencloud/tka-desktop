# Kinetic Alphabet System Overview

## 🎯 What is the Kinetic Alphabet?

The Kinetic Alphabet is a **comprehensive notation system** for describing multi-dimensional movement patterns using props (staffs, poi, clubs, etc.). It provides a mathematical framework for encoding, analyzing, and communicating complex kinetic sequences.

### Core Philosophy

- **Mathematical completeness**: Any physical prop motion should be expressible within the system
- **Progressive complexity**: 8 levels from basic to advanced, each building on previous levels
- **Backward compatibility**: Higher levels extend but never break lower levels
- **Practical implementability**: Each level represents an achievable milestone with concrete value

```
Radial Orientations:     Non-Radial Orientations:

IN:  ●→ (toward center)  CLOCK:    ↻ (clockwise)
OUT: ←● (away from center) COUNTER: ↺ (counter-clockwise)
```

#### 3. Motion Types

```
PRO:    Prospin rotation while moving
ANTI:   Antispin rotation while moving
STATIC: No rotation while moving
DASH:   Quick transition movement
FLOAT:  Smooth flowing movement (-0.5 turns)
```

#### 4. Rotation System

```
Level 1-2: Whole turns only (0, 1, 2, 3)
Level 3+:  Half turns allowed (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3)
Level 8:   Intermediate orientations (8 total orientations)
