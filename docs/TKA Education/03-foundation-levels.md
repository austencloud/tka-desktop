# Foundation Levels: Core System (Levels 1-3)

## üéØ Foundation Overview

Levels 1-3 form the **mathematical foundation** of the Kinetic Alphabet system. These levels establish core concepts that remain constant throughout all higher levels while progressively adding complexity in manageable increments.

### Foundation Progression

```
Level 1: Basic Letters      ‚Üí Core vocabulary (positions, orientations, motions)
Level 2: Turn Variations    ‚Üí Add rotational complexity
Level 3: Orientation Freedom ‚Üí Complete orientation system
```

## üìö Level 1: Basic Alphabetic Letters

### Core Concept

**Base kinetic vocabulary with radial orientations only**

Establishes the fundamental building blocks of the kinetic alphabet system without any advanced complexity. Focus is on understanding positions, basic orientations, and motion types.

### Technical Specifications

#### Grid System

```
Diamond Mode (Cardinals):    Box Mode (Intercardinals):
    N                           NE    NW
W   ‚óè   E                         ‚óè
    S                           SE    SW

Constraint: Both hands must use SAME mode in any single beat
```

#### Orientations (Radial Only)

```
IN:  ‚óè‚Üí (toward center)     Available at all positions
OUT: ‚Üê‚óè (away from center)  Available at all positions

NOT Available: CLOCK, COUNTER (non-radial orientations)
```

#### Motion Types (4 of 5 Available)

```
‚úÖ PRO:    Prospin rotation while moving

```

#### Rotations

```
0 turns only - no rotational complexity

```

### Mathematical Properties

#### Position Space

- **8 discrete positions** arranged in geometric patterns

- **Polar coordinate system**: All positions relative to center point
- **Binary orientation**: Only 2 orientation options per position

#### Combination Mathematics

```
Diamond Mode: 4 positions √ó 2 orientations √ó 4 motion types = 32 base combinations
Box Mode:     4 positions √ó 2 orientations √ó 4 motion types = 32 base combinations
Valid Pairs:  Diamond√óDiamond + Box√óBox ‚âà 16-24 practical combinations
```

#### Validation Logic

```python
def is_valid_level1_combination(blue_pos, red_pos):
    blue_mode = get_position_mode(blue_pos)  # diamond or box
    red_mode = get_position_mode(red_pos)    # diamond or box
    return blue_mode == red_mode             # Must match!
```
