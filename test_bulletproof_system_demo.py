TKA Desktop Bulletproof Test System Demonstration
=================================================

This test file demonstrates that the bulletproof test system works with ANY
execution method an AI assistant or developer might try.

Execution Methods That Work:
    python test_bulletproof_system_demo.py
    pytest test_bulletproof_system_demo.py
    python -m pytest test_bulletproof_system_demo.py
    python run_test.py test_bulletproof_system_demo.py
    python run_test.py --pytest test_bulletproof_system_demo.py

From Any Directory:
    cd modern && python ../test_bulletproof_system_demo.py
    cd modern && pytest ../test_bulletproof_system_demo.py

IDE Test Runners:
    Just click "Run Test" in VS Code, PyCharm, etc.
