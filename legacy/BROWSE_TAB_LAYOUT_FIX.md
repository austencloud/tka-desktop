# Browse Tab Layout Fix - 2:1 Aspect Ratio

## Problem Description

The browse tab's layout was not maintaining the correct 2:1 aspect ratio (width:height) for the viewer component. The viewer component should occupy 1/3 of the total width (right panel) while the sequence picker should occupy 2/3 of the total width (left panel), creating a 2:1 ratio between left and right panels.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by conflicting layout management approaches:

1. **Fixed Width vs Stretch Factors**: The tab switcher was using `setFixedWidth()` which completely overrode the stretch factors set in the layout
2. **Multiple Layout Systems**: Different components were trying to control the layout independently
3. **Redundant Width Constraints**: Individual widgets had their own width calculation methods that interfered with the layout system
4. **Inconsistent Enforcement**: Layout constraints were only enforced after certain events, not consistently

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Unified Layout Management
- **Replaced fixed width constraints with stretch factors** throughout the system
- **Consistent 2:1 stretch ratio**: Left stack gets stretch factor 2, right stack gets stretch factor 1
- **Removed conflicting width calculation methods** from individual widgets

### 2. Files Modified

#### Main Tab Switcher (`src/main_window/main_widget/main_widget_tab_switcher.py`)
- Replaced `setFixedWidth()` calls with `setStretch()` calls
- Updated both `switch_tab()` and `set_stacks_silently()` methods
- Added clearing of maximum/minimum width constraints

#### Parallel Stack Fader (`src/main_window/main_widget/fade_manager/parallel_stack_fader.py`)
- Updated to use stretch factors directly instead of scaling them
- Improved fallback logic for width ratio calculations
- Added proper constraint clearing

#### Sequence Viewer (`src/main_window/main_widget/browse_tab/sequence_viewer/sequence_viewer.py`)
- Changed size policy from `Maximum` to `Preferred` to allow proper layout management
- Removed redundant `_enforce_width_constraint()` method
- Updated size policy to respect layout stretch factors

#### Sequence Picker (`src/main_window/main_widget/browse_tab/sequence_picker/sequence_picker.py`)
- Removed redundant `_enforce_width_constraint()` method
- Updated size policy to work with layout stretch factors

#### Browse Tab Selection Handler (`src/main_window/main_widget/browse_tab/browse_tab_selection_handler.py`)
- Updated constraint enforcement to clear both left and right stack constraints
- Improved error handling and logging

#### Thumbnail Components
- **Thumbnail Box** (`src/main_window/main_widget/browse_tab/thumbnail_box/thumbnail_box.py`)
- **Thumbnail Image Label** (`src/main_window/main_widget/browse_tab/thumbnail_box/thumbnail_image_label.py`)
- Updated width calculation methods to use actual widget sizes instead of ratio calculations
- This prevents feedback loops and respects the layout system's decisions

### 3. Key Changes Summary

1. **Stretch Factor Consistency**: All layout management now uses stretch factors (2, 1) for browse tab
2. **Constraint Clearing**: All fixed width constraints are properly cleared when switching tabs
3. **Widget Size Policies**: Updated to `Preferred` instead of `Maximum` to allow proper layout
4. **Actual Size Usage**: Thumbnail components now use actual widget sizes instead of calculating ratios

## Testing

### Automated Test
A new test has been created: `src/testing/browse_tab_aspect_ratio_test.py`

To run the test:
```python
from src.testing.browse_tab_aspect_ratio_test import run_aspect_ratio_test

# Assuming you have a main_widget instance
success = run_aspect_ratio_test(main_widget)
if success:
    print("✅ Browse tab layout test passed!")
else:
    print("❌ Browse tab layout test failed!")
```

### Manual Testing
1. **Switch to Browse Tab**: Verify the left panel is ~2/3 width, right panel is ~1/3 width
2. **Resize Window**: Verify the 2:1 ratio is maintained during window resizing
3. **Select Thumbnails**: Verify the ratio remains stable when selecting different thumbnails
4. **Switch Between Tabs**: Verify the layout is correctly restored when returning to browse tab

### Expected Results
- Left panel (sequence picker) should be approximately 66.7% of total content width
- Right panel (sequence viewer) should be approximately 33.3% of total content width
- Ratio between left and right panels should be 2:1 (±20% tolerance)
- Layout should remain stable during all user interactions

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Layout**: The 2:1 aspect ratio is now maintained consistently
2. **Responsive Design**: Layout properly responds to window resizing
3. **Simplified Code**: Removed redundant and conflicting layout management code
4. **Better Performance**: Eliminated feedback loops in width calculations
5. **Maintainable**: Single source of truth for layout ratios using Qt's stretch factor system

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible. The existing API remains unchanged, and the improvements are internal to the layout management system.
