# Beat Deleter Dependency Injection Fix

## Problem Description

The application was throwing an `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'option_picker'` when trying to delete beats in the sequence workbench. The error occurred in the `NonFirstBeatDeleter` class when it tried to access the construct tab's option picker using the old direct access pattern:

```python
self.option_picker = self.deleter.main_widget.construct_tab.option_picker
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was caused by the transition from the old direct widget access pattern to the new dependency injection system. The beat deleter classes were still using the old pattern:

1. **Direct Access**: `main_widget.construct_tab.option_picker`
2. **Problem**: `construct_tab` was `None` because tabs are now created lazily through factories
3. **Solution**: Use the new `get_tab_widget()` method with graceful fallbacks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated NonFirstBeatDeleter

**File**: `src/main_window/main_widget/sequence_workbench/beat_deleter/non_first_beat_deleter.py`

**Changes**:
- Replaced direct `construct_tab` access with `_get_construct_tab()` method
- Added graceful fallback pattern for backward compatibility
- Added null checks before accessing option picker
- Updated both `delete_non_first_beat()` and `_delete_beat_and_following()` methods

**Before**:
```python
self.option_picker = self.deleter.main_widget.construct_tab.option_picker
```

**After**:
```python
construct_tab = self._get_construct_tab()
if not construct_tab or not hasattr(construct_tab, 'option_picker'):
    # Graceful fallback
    self._delete_beat_and_following(selected_beat)
    return
self.option_picker = construct_tab.option_picker
```

### 2. Updated FirstBeatDeleter

**File**: `src/main_window/main_widget/sequence_workbench/beat_deleter/first_beat_deleter.py`

**Changes**:
- Applied the same pattern as NonFirstBeatDeleter
- Added `_get_construct_tab()` method with graceful fallbacks
- Updated both `delete_first_beat()` and `_delete_beat_and_following()` methods

### 3. Graceful Fallback Pattern

Both classes now use this pattern for accessing the construct tab:

```python
def _get_construct_tab(self):
    """Get the construct tab using the new dependency injection pattern with graceful fallbacks."""
    try:
        # Try to get construct tab through the new coordinator pattern
        return self.deleter.main_widget.get_tab_widget("construct")
    except AttributeError:
        # Fallback: try through tab_manager for backward compatibility
        try:
            return self.deleter.main_widget.tab_manager.get_tab_widget("construct")
        except AttributeError:
            # Final fallback: try direct access for legacy compatibility
            try:
                if hasattr(self.deleter.main_widget, "construct_tab"):
                    return self.deleter.main_widget.construct_tab
            except AttributeError:
                pass
    return None
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Robustness
- **Null Safety**: Added proper null checks before accessing construct tab and option picker
- **Graceful Degradation**: If construct tab is not available, operations continue without crashing
- **Multiple Fallbacks**: Three levels of fallback for maximum compatibility

### 2. Backward Compatibility
- **Legacy Support**: Still works with old direct access pattern if new system isn't available
- **Gradual Migration**: Allows for gradual transition to new dependency injection system
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved

### 3. Error Prevention
- **Defensive Programming**: Checks for attribute existence before accessing
- **Exception Handling**: Proper try-catch blocks to handle AttributeError
- **Logging Ready**: Structure allows for easy addition of logging if needed

## Files Modified

1. `src/main_window/main_widget/sequence_workbench/beat_deleter/non_first_beat_deleter.py`
   - Added `_get_construct_tab()` method
   - Updated `delete_non_first_beat()` method
   - Updated `_delete_beat_and_following()` method

2. `src/main_window/main_widget/sequence_workbench/beat_deleter/first_beat_deleter.py`
   - Added `_get_construct_tab()` method
   - Updated `delete_first_beat()` method
   - Updated `_delete_beat_and_following()` method

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. **Beat Deletion**: Verify that deleting beats no longer throws AttributeError
2. **First Beat**: Test deleting the first beat in a sequence
3. **Middle Beats**: Test deleting beats in the middle of a sequence
4. **Last Beat**: Test deleting the last beat in a sequence
5. **Empty Sequence**: Test behavior when no beats are present

### Expected Behavior
- Beat deletion should work smoothly without errors
- Option picker should update correctly after deletion
- Fade animations should work as expected
- Construct tab should transition properly based on remaining beats

## Benefits

1. **Stability**: Eliminates AttributeError crashes during beat deletion
2. **Maintainability**: Uses consistent dependency injection pattern
3. **Flexibility**: Supports both old and new widget access patterns
4. **Reliability**: Graceful handling of missing or uninitialized components

## Future Considerations

- Consider adding logging to track which fallback method is being used
- Monitor for any remaining direct access patterns in other components
- Eventually remove legacy fallbacks once full migration is complete
