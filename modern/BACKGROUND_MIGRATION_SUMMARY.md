- All timing intervals maintained
- All physics calculations intact
- All image loading and caching preserved

### ✅ **Architecture Improvements**

- Clean separation of concerns
- Factory pattern for easy background switching

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.presentation.components.backgrounds.background_widget import BackgroundWidget

# Create animated background widget
background = BackgroundWidget("Aurora", parent_widget)
background.setGeometry(parent_widget.rect())
```

### Factory Usage

```python
from src.presentation.components.backgrounds.background_factory import BackgroundFactory

# Get available background types
types = BackgroundFactory.get_available_backgrounds()
# Returns: ["Aurora", "Bubbles", "Snowfall", "Starfield"]

# Create specific background
aurora = BackgroundFactory.create_background("Aurora", parent)
```

### Dynamic Switching

```python
# Switch backgrounds at runtime
background_widget.set_background_type("Bubbles")
```

## Success Criteria Met

This migration successfully achieved the goal of preserving all sophisticated animation logic while moving it to a cleaner architectural structure. The background system now provides:

1. **Same Visual Quality**: All backgrounds animate identically to legacy
2. **Better Organization**: Clean separation and modular design
3. **Easy Integration**: Simple API for modern components
4. **Maintainability**: Clear structure for future enhancements
5. **Performance**: No degradation from migration

The complex clockwork mechanism has been successfully moved to its new, modern housing while preserving every gear, spring, and timing element that made the original system work beautifully.
