TEST LIFECYCLE: REGRESSION
PURPOSE: Prevent [specific bug or performance issue] from reoccurring
BUG_REPORT: #[issue_number] or [description of the original problem]
FIXED_DATE: [YYYY-MM-DD when the bug was fixed]

INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI AGENTS:
This is a REGRESSION test that prevents a specific bug from reoccurring.
Only suggest deletion if the entire feature is removed from the system.
Focus on reproducing the exact scenario that caused the original bug.
