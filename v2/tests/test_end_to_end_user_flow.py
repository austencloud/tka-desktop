"""
End-to-end test that simulates the complete user interaction flow:
1. User starts the application
2. User selects a start position
3. User clicks on a beat option in the option picker
4. Verify the entire flow works without errors

This test catches real-world errors that unit tests miss.

TEST LIFECYCLE: SPECIFICATION
PURPOSE: Ensure the core user flow of selecting a beat and updating the workbench and graph editor works as expected.
PERMANENT: This is a fundamental user interaction.
